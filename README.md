# conio4gcc
This is conio.h compatible header file for gcc.

# How to implement?
Simply copy the 'conio.h' file to your 'include' directory.  
e.g. sudo cp conio.h /usr/include

### Hint: 
sudo make install copies conio.h to the include directory.  
sudo make uninstall removes conio.h from the include directory.
